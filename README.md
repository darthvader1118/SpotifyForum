When on the playlist posting page, TrackShare users can choose from the playlists they have made in the Spotify app to post to TrackShare for the world to see. We encourage users to post their "Discover Weekly" playlists so all users can discover the joy of new music.

Once the playlist has been posted, it is placed into a list of playlists posted by other Trackshare users. You can click on each playlist tile and comment on the playlist. Users are also encouraged to download a discovered playlist to their Spotify account.
